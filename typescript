DESCRIPTION
       Bash  is  an  sh-compatible  command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also incorporates
       useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).

       Bash is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard  1003.1).   Bash
       can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.

OPTIONS
       All  of  the  single-character  shell options documented in the description of the set builtin command, including -o, can be used as options when the
       shell is invoked.  In addition, bash interprets the following options when it is invoked:

       -c        If the -c option is present, then commands are read from the first non-option argument command_string.  If there are  arguments  after  the
                 command_string, the first argument is assigned to $0 and any remaining arguments are assigned to the positional parameters.  The assignment
                 to $0 sets the name of the shell, which is used in warning and error messages.
       -i        If the -i option is present, the shell is interactive.
       -l        Make bash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see INVOCATION below).
       -r        If the -r option is present, the shell becomes restricted (see RESTRICTED SHELL below).
       -s        If the -s option is present, or if no arguments remain after option processing, then commands are read from the standard input.   This  op‐
                 tion allows the positional parameters to be set when invoking an interactive shell or when reading input through a pipe.
       -v        Print shell input lines as they are read.
       -x        Print commands and their arguments as they are executed.
       -D        A  list  of  all double-quoted strings preceded by $ is printed on the standard output.  These are the strings that are subject to language
                 translation when the current locale is not C or POSIX.  This implies the -n option; no commands will be executed.
       [-+]O [shopt_option]
                 shopt_option is one of the shell options accepted by the shopt builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  If shopt_option is present,  -O
                 sets  the value of that option; +O unsets it.  If shopt_option is not supplied, the names and values of the shell options accepted by shopt
                 are printed on the standard output.  If the invocation option is +O, the output is displayed in a format that may be reused as input.
       --        A -- signals the end of options and disables further option processing.  Any arguments after the -- are treated as filenames and arguments.
                 An argument of - is equivalent to --.

       Bash  also  interprets  a number of multi-character options.  These options must appear on the command line before the single-character options to be
       recognized.

       --debugger
              Arrange for the debugger profile to be executed before the shell starts.  Turns on extended debugging mode (see the description of the  extde‐
              bug option to the shopt builtin below).
       --dump-po-strings
              Equivalent to -D, but the output is in the GNU gettext po (portable object) file format.
       --dump-strings
              Equivalent to -D.
       --help Display a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.
       --init-file file
       --rcfile file
              Execute  commands  from  file  instead  of  the system wide initializa
